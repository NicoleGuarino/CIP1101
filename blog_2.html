        <h2>Banff National Park, Canada</h2>
        <p>Encompassing more than 6,600 square kilometres in Alberta’s Rocky Mountains, Banff National Park is the oldest national park in Canada. The mountainous landscape features alpine areas, coniferous forests, ice fields, glaciers, and glacial lakes with pristine blue water.
            The park is home to mammals such as the cougar, bighorn sheep, elk, grey wolf, grizzly bear, moose, and wolverine. In addition to going for drives or walks on which you might spot some of these magnificent creatures, you can enjoy various recreational activities too. You can stay in chalets or go camping, and you can go mountain biking, paddling, skiing or relax in the nearby hot springs. Banff National Park is one of the coolest places in the world that you’ll want to visit again and again.</p>

        <p>Facts about Banff National Park is that Lake Louise, Moraine Lake, Peyto Lake, and Bow Lake get their colour from the glaciers that surround them. In the springtime and early summer, melting glaciers run into the lake and deposit fine rock "flour" ground by moving glaciers, which in turn refracts the sunlight. The colour can change daily depending on the light, but in general, you can expect these lakes to always glow azure in the summer making it look blue or sometimes emerald</p>
