        <h2>Travel Tips on the Ground</h2>
        <img src="/midtermexam/images/blog-4.png">
        <p>Don’t over extend yourself or pack too many activities into a single day. As much as you want to see it all, try to be selective. In fact, give yourself a day to relax and recover from jet lag, especially if you’re crossing time zones, traveling from the west to the east.<br> <br>
            Wear comfortable shoes and clothing before hitting the streets and avoid carrying too much cash or expensive valuables like jewelry.<br> <br>
            Keep your valuables close and out of sight. Carry traveler’s cheques and credit cards on a belt worn under your clothes. Consider carrying a dummy wallet holding a small amount of cash to dupe a mugger who demands your money.<br> <br>
            Know all the contact details for the American embassy. They’re used to helping American travelers get out of tight spots.<br> <br>
            Drink bottle water if you are at all unsure of the water supply.<br> <br>
            Avoid seafood and undercooked meats, peeled and raw fruits and vegetables and unpasteurized dairy products to reduce chances of food poisoning. Don’t buy food from street vendors.<br> <br>
            Wear thongs in public showers to reduce the risk of infectious diseases.<br> <br>
            Learn a few key phrases of your host country. Chances are your hosts will speak English but you will more easily earn their courtesy and cooperation by making any earnest attempt to speak their language. D’accord?</p>
